/**
 * WorkBuddy models for DeepSeek Harness, reusing the WorkBuddy desktop apps'

 * app and `workbuddy-ai` for the international one — while streaming, tool
 * calls, compaction, and permissions stay Harness-owned.
 *
 * The two variants are assembled by the same factory and differ only in their
 * {@link WorkBuddyVariant} descriptor: each gets its own credential store,
 * catalog, upstream client, shim, adapter, probe state, and routes. Neither
 * variant's startup, catalog fetch, or credential state can stop the other from

  // distinct settings onto one — and on 0.1.5 their two cards onto one.
  // (The Models settings page does not join on these on any version — the
  // plugin registers no configurable-provider directory entry, so that page
  // lists neither provider.)
  //
  // DSH 0.1.2 moved the helper from a free function (`installSettingsSection`)
  // onto the provider service (`settings.installSection`), so the wiring now has
  // to wait for a settings service to exist — exactly what the inject below
  // does. Without one the plugin still serves its models; it simply has no

     * Calling the old API there would throw mid-inject, so it is

     * maximum-context preference are absent, and without an exception.
     * (Since 0.7.0 the peers admit 0.2.0 cores only; the pre-0.2.0 branches
     * are structural compatibility carried over from the 0.6.x line, not a
     * current support promise.)
     *
     * The guard reads the API off a narrowed view rather than indexing the
     * service directly, because `installSection` is not a member of the 0.2.0
     * `SettingsForms` type at all: an `in`/`typeof` probe on that type is a
