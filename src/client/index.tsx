/**
 * Browser half: the WorkBuddy account cards, on whichever settings surface the
 * host provides.
 *
 * One bundle serves two DSH generations. DSH 0.1.5 renders plugin cards in the
 * settings Plugins tab, which dispatches the keyed `settings.plugin.item` slot
 * once per served settings namespace (one card per WorkBuddy variant). DSH
 * 0.1.6 moved plugin configuration to the Plugins page, whose
 * `plugins.bundle.config` slot carries one bundle-keyed entry that renders both
 * variants itself. `ctx.slots.inject` follows the slot's declaration lifetime —
 * the callback runs where the slot is declared and simply never runs where it
 * is not — so registering BOTH seams needs no host-version check: each host
 * materializes exactly the seam it ships.
