/**
 * WorkBuddy 5.6.x at-rest credential protection: classification, key
 * resolution, and field decryption for the desktop apps' encrypted auth files.
 *
 * Since WorkBuddy 5.6 both desktop apps (CN and international, which followed
 * in 5.6.2) encrypt `auth.accessToken` and `auth.refreshToken` at rest
 * (`buildPolicy: "fields"`, on by default), so the plugin reads
 * `{$wbEncrypted:1, envelope}` wrappers instead of token strings (issues
 * #39/#40, #59/#60). Everything needed to open them lives on the same machine:
 *
 * - the sealed payload (`{version:1, atRestSecretKey}`) comes from the
 *   WorkBuddy-modified Electron's private `workbuddyStorage` binding, reached
 *   by running *its own* binary once with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`;
 * - `protectorKey = sha256(atRestSecretKey, utf8)` opens the envelopes with
 *   AES-256-GCM; the AAD builder below is transcribed from the app's own
 *   `buildAuthenticatedContextAad` (verified live against 5.6.2, see
 *   `docs/r3-final.js` in the working copy — not committed).
 *
 * The plugin process itself can never call `_linkedBinding` (it runs in DSH's
 * Node, not the forked Electron), so the helper is spawned. The key is cached
 * in memory only, single-flight, and re-resolved when an envelope names a
 * different key id. Neither the payload, the key, nor any token is ever
 * logged; error messages carry sizes, ids, and exit codes only.
 *

 *
 * This is a FIXED, PUBLIC constant of the WorkBuddy client, not a per-install
 * or per-user secret: it is the static protector the app ships, identical
 * across installations and machines. It is readable from any WorkBuddy desktop
 * binary that happens to be installed —
 *
 *   process._linkedBinding('electron_browser_workbuddy_storage').loggerGet()
 *   // -> {"version":1,"atRestSecretKey":"<this value>", ...}

 * — but that route needs the app's own Electron binary, which does not exist on
 * Linux at all and may be absent, moved, or sandboxed elsewhere. Embedding the
 * constant makes decryption independent of that binary, which is what lets a
 * credential file be opened on a machine where the app is not installed.
 *
 * Consequence, stated plainly: this value plus any credential file is enough to
 * recover the tokens inside it. That is already true of the app itself, so the
 * constant is not a new disclosure — but it means the plugin's protection here
 * is *format*, not secrecy. Treat a leaked credential file as leaked tokens.
 *
 * It remains only a FALLBACK. The app's own payload wins whenever it can be
 * read, so a future WorkBuddy that rotates its protector still works through
 * the binary path; see {@link WorkBuddyAtRestKeyProvider}.
 *
 * Provenance: measured from the CN app's private `workbuddyStorage` binding on
